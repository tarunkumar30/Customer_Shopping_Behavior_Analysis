# Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis
🚀 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis – End-to-End Data  Analysis Project

I analyzed 3,900 customer transactions to uncover insights into spending patterns, subscription behavior, and product performance.

🔎 What I did:

Cleaned and transformed data using Python (Pandas)

Handled missing values using category-wise median imputation

Performed business analysis using MySQL

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard

📊 Key Insights:

73% customers are non-subscribers

Young adults generate the highest revenue

Clothing category drives maximum sales

Discount usage does not always mean lower spending

🛠 Tools Used:
Python | MySQL | Power BI

This project helped me understand how raw data becomes business decisions.
